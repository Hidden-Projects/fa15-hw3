1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?
     Create will save to the database but new will not.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?
     save

3. What is the column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?
     id

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "hat" in the database?
     Cat.create name:"hat"

5. What was the most confusing part over the last few weeks?
     Figuring out where files need to go and what function they all perform.  It would be nice to have a cheatsheet of everything that we've learned in class so far.

6. How did you like this homework in comparison with the others?
     I liked it a bit more, although if I had a cheatsheet as mentioned above it would have been much easier! It was nice to see an actual dynamic backend coming together.
